mustread for every entrepreneur a holistic generous human emotional long term storydriven approach to your business the world would be a much better place if businesses were led this way youll have a competitive advantage if you do this since so few do my notes marketing in five steps 1 invent a thing worth making with a story worth telling and a contribution worth talking about 2 design and build it in a way that a few people will particularly benefit from and care about 3 tell a story that matches the builtin narrative and dreams of that tiny group of people the smallest viable market 4 spread the word 5 show up  regularly consistently and generously for years and years  to organize and lead and build confidence in the change you seek to make anchor your work deeply in the dreams desires and communities of those you seek to serve do work that matters for people who care making is insufficient you havent made an impact until youve changed someone resonate with the listener tell them something theyve been waiting to hear invite them on a journey where a change might happen the best way to complain is to make things better it doesnt make any sense to make a key and then run around looking for a lock to open the only productive solution is to find a lock and then fashion a key if you want to make change begin by making culture begin by organizing a tightly knit group begin by getting people in sync ask whos it for to focus your actions change is best made with intent whats it for what you say isnt nearly as important as what others say about you people dont want what you make they want what it will do for them they want belonging connection peace of mind status humans are lonely they want to be seen and known people want to be part of something create experiences using a product engaging with a service calling customer service each of these actions is part of the story each builds a little bit of our connection offer these experiences with intent doing them on purpose if you have to choose a thousand people to become your true fans who should you choose worldview a worldview is the shortcut the lens each of us uses when we see the world its our assumptions and biases and stereotypes about the world around us pursuit of mass will make you boring because mass means average begin instead with the smallest viable market whats the minimum number of people you would need to influence to make it worth the effort be choosy about which people choose the people who want what youre offering choose the people most open to hearing your message choose the people who will tell the right other people specific means accountable it worked or it didnt are you hiding behind everyone or anyone youll never be able to serve everyone which is comforting since youre less likely to be disappointed when it doesnt happen find a corner of the market that cant wait for your attention overwhelm this groups wants and dreams and desires with your care your attention and your focus make profound change happen figure out the simplest useful version of your product engage with the market and then improve and repeat loving you is a way of expressing themselves becoming part of your movement is an expression of who they are that love becomes part of their identity a chance to do something that feels right to express themselves through their contributions their actions and the badge they wear instead of talking about prospects and customers we could call them your students instead what will they benefit from learning are they open to being taught what will they tell others we must say its not for you youre not going to waste their time pander to them or insist that they change their beliefs it shows respect for those you seek to serve to say to them i made this for you not for the other folks but for you im doing this for people who believe _________________ i will focus on people who want _________________ i promise that engaging with what i make will help you get _________________ match the worldview of the people being served show up in the world with a story that they want to hear told in a language theyre eager to understand make it easy to spread if every member brings in one more member within a few years youll have more members than you can count earn and keep the attention and trust of those you serve offer ways to go deeper sonder is defined as that moment when you realize that everyone around you has an internal life as rich and as conflicted as yours everyone wants something that they cant possibly have and if they could have it theyd discover that they didnt really want it all along everyone is lonely insecure and a bit of a fraud and everyone cares about something find a spot on the map with edges that some people want to find signal so that people who are looking for you can easily find you were this not that dog food is for dog owners not dogs its for the way it makes them feel  the satisfaction of taking care of an animal the people you seek to serve care about a range of inputs and emotions not simply a contest for whos the cheapest choose your extremes and you choose your market and vice versa neophiliacs  early adopters neophiliacs get a thrill from discovery they enjoy the tension of this might not work and they get pleasure from bragging about their discoveries neophiliacs are very forgiving of missteps from those who seek to innovate with them and incredibly unforgiving after the initial thrill of discovery wears off you cant be perfect in the eyes of an early adopter the best you can do is be interesting sometimes youll be creating interesting new work for people who are easily bored and sometimes youll build products and services that last that can extend beyond the tiny group of neophiliacs and reach and delight the rest of the market draw a simple xy grid pick two axes for each axis choose something that people care about speed price convenience performance ingredients purity sustainability obviousness maintenance costs safety edginess distribution network effect imminence visibility trendiness privacy popularity professionalism difficulty elitism danger experimental healthfulness  different offerings on this xy axis treat different people differently they dont compete theyre simply on the same board when you look at the list of available attributes its tempting to pick the ones that most people care about after all its hard work to claim an edge and to pick one that few people care about seems foolish better we think to pick the popular one if you do youll certainly be choosing a crowded quadrant its very difficult to grow in a quadrant thats crowded the alternative is to build your own quadrant to find two axes that have been overlooked that puts you in a position where you are the clear and obvious choice outsource the tasks and find the guts to do emotional labor instead the most frustrated marketers i know are the ones who take it as a given that because they are in industry x they have no freedom they do precisely what the others do boosting our posts counting our followers and creating ever more content in the hope of being noticed there are so many other ways to make an impact and earn trust a decade ago it took a dedicated team of publishers print brokers and sales reps to get a book to be available nationwide now a kindle book can be published by one smart person with a digital file we made the doing easier which is precisely why we need to outsource that part of our job and focus all our energy onto the hard work of making change happen we still talk about being very good at our craft as if its some sort of bizarre exception plenty of people are good at what you do quality is required but no longer sufficient your customers know more than you do about your competitors and so your commodity work is not enough if we merely try to fill a hole in the market were doomed driven by scarcity focused on market share the alternative is to find and build and earn your story once you claim a story youre on the hook to deliver authenticity in the marketplace is a myth what people want is to be understood and to be served not merely to witness whatever you feel like doing in a given moment you are not expected or welcome to bring us every one of your insecurities innermost fears and urgent demands youre here to serve emotional labor is the work of doing what we dont feel like doing its about showing up with a smile when were wincing inside if you need to be authentic to do your best work youre not a professional exert emotional labor in search of empathy  the empathy to imagine what someone else would want what they might believe what story would resonate with them we dont do this work because we feel like it in the moment we do this work this draining emotional labor because were professionals and because we want to make change happen emotional labor is the work we do to provide service what do people want if you ask them you probably wont find what youre looking for its our job to watch people figure out what they dream of and then create a transaction that can deliver that feeling people are intimately aware of their wants which they think of as needs but they are absolutely terrible at inventing new ways to address those wants they often prefer to use a familiar solution to satisfy their wants even if its not working very well the seven billion people on this planet share a basket of desires adventure affection avoiding new things belonging community control creativity delight freedom of expression freedom of movement friendship good looks health learning new things luxury nostalgia obedience participation peace of mind physical activity power reassurance reliability respect revenge romance safety security sex strength sympathy tension artists dont need many colors to paint an original masterpiece just address these desires the people who are happy with boring are actively avoiding you the only people we can serve are curious dissatisfied or bored make an assertion outline a promise choose your extremes find the people you seek to change and show up with your offer call it a test if you want to but its real life the real life of engaging with whats possible and of working with people who want to make a change always be seeking connecting solving asserting believing seeing and yes testing sometimes youll be right but most of the time youll be wrong thats okay what could make a book worth two hundred dollars or a hotel room worth fifteen hundred dollars more of the same is the wrong answer we dont pay ten times extra for more words instead its a different extreme people bend themselves into a pretzel trying to please the anonymous masses before they have fifty or one hundred people who would miss them if they were gone instead of asking for feedback seek advice like this i made something that i like that i thought youd like howd i do what advice do you have for how i could make it fit your worldview more closely its worth the effort to insulate ourselves from a raw emotional onslaught and to tease out substantial useful direction instead at the heart of the exclusive organization is a simple truth every member is people like us sign up for that and you gain status walk away and you lose it to change a culture begin with an exclusive cohort your work is a tree the roots live in the soil of dreams and desires of those you seek to serve if your work is simply a commodity a quick response to an obvious demand then your roots dont run deep its unlikely that your tree will grow or even if it does its unlikely to be seen as important useful or dominant it will be crowded out by all the similar trees as your tree grows it creates a beacon for the community the early adopters among the people you seek to serve can engage with the tree climb it use it for shade and eventually eat the fruits and they attract the others if you have planned well the tree will quickly grow taller because the sun isnt being blocked  there are few other trees in the same area as the tree grows it not only attracts other people but its height as the dominant choice in the neighborhood blocks out the futile efforts of other similar trees the market likes a winner its a mistake to show up with an acorn and expect a crowd a pattern interrupt requires some sort of jolt tension is created and energy is diverted to consider this new input is it something worth considering most of the time for most of those you seek to reach the answer is no because the patterns are established time is precious and risk is something to be feared if you want someone who has never hired a gardener to hire you to be their gardener youre asking for a pattern interrupt the pattern requires undoing before you can earn forward motion when life interferes new patterns are established this is why its so profitable to market to new dads engaged women and people who have recently moved they dont have a pattern to match so its all an interrupt the best time to market a new app is when the platform is brand new when you market to someone who doesnt have a pattern yet you dont have to persuade them that their old choices were mistakes why do some people hesitate to ask a question during a class but will happily answer the professor if theyre called on the teacher applies focused social tension in the form of publicly calling on a student the tension was sufficient to overcome his or her inertia we create tension when we ask someone were using one force social engagement to overcome another force the status quo launch a new project and in addition to serving your audience youll be breaking something the very existence of an alternative causes something else to no longer be true when you launch an extreme the most efficient the least expensive the most convenient then whatever youve exceeded is no longer the extreme that its fans sought out the tension people face any time theyre about to cross a threshold the tension of this might work versus this might not work the tension of if i learn this will i like who i become all effective education creates tension because just before you learn something youre aware you dont know it yet when they started building fancy casinos in las vegas it created tension for countless travelers visitors who just a year earlier were happy in reno or in downtown las vegas now felt like secondclass citizens they asked am i the sort of person who goes to a casino this rundown the very existence of a fancier alternative degraded their experience at their former favorite the desire to change our status or to protect it drives almost everything we do its a mistake to believe that everyone wants to make their status higher in fact few people do its also a mistake to believe that no one wants to make their status lower if youve been conditioned to see yourself in a certain status role you might fight to maintain and even lower your status status is always relative its about perception of status relative to others in the group status is in the eyes of the beholder status has inertia were more likely to work to maintain our status high or low than we are to try to change it status is learned our beliefs about status start early and yet the cohort we are with can influence our perception of our status in very little time shame is the status killer if we accept the shame someone sends our way it undermines our entire narrative about relative status focus on those with low status instead of yourself one can enjoy as much status by letting someone into the flow of traffic as they can from cutting him off the status that comes from the community the status of respect in return for contribution for caring for seeing and being in sync with others especially others with no ability to repay you this type of status is not im better its im connected im family for a local craftsperson status means hunkering down in a single neighborhood until a reputation is assured dominion is a vertical experience above or below affiliation is a horizontal one whos standing next to me when we pick up a book that feels selfpublished we treat it differently than the book that reminds us of a classic we read in high school the internet is littered with websites emails and videos made by amateurs amateurs who made something that they liked which is fine but what a professional does for you is design something that other people will like they create a look and feel that reminds people of their sort of magic what a good designer offers you the chance to fit in you might choose to hire a great designer instead someone who can break the expectation and talk differently but not so differently that you dont resonate with those you seek to connect with whats your brand hint its not your logo in a supercrowded world a brand is a shorthand for the customers expectations what promise do they think youre making make a list of five logos you admire each one represents a brand you admire almost no one picks a swastika or the clever glyph of the bank who ripped them off logos are so wrapped up in the brand promise that we imbue them with all the powers of the brand ignoring the pixels involved its possible for a terrible logo to adorn a fabulous brand like the complicated mermaid of starbucks pick a logo dont spend a ton of money and keep it for as long as you keep your first name if someone is satisfied with what they have youre unlikely to have the time or the money to reach out to them directly and cause them to become dissatisfied begin with the neophiliacs the folks with a problem that you can solve right now novelty and tension and the endless search for better neophiliacs want to go first they want hope and possibility and magic they want the thrill of it working and the risk that it might not they want the pleasure of showing their innovation to the rest treat different people differently when you find someone who is eager to talk about what you do give them something to talk about treat different people differently when you find someone who is itching to become a generous leader give them the resources to lead youll serve many people youll profit from a few seek out and delight the few treat different people differently while everyone has a platform not everyone is using it we can list tactics strategy is the umbrella over your tactics if you tell your competition your tactics theyll steal them and it will cost you but if you tell them your strategy it wont matter direct marketing is action oriented and it is measured brand marketing is culturally oriented and it cant be measured if you run an ad on facebook and count your clicks and then measure how many of them convert youre doing direct marketing if youre buying direct marketing ads measure everything if youre buying brand marketing ads refuse to measure instead be consistent and patient overinvest in the way your team interacts with customers every slice of every interaction ought to reflect the whole every time we see any of you we ought to be able to make a smart guess about all of you we remember the things that we see again and again marketers forget this because we get bored with our stuff so we change it seo is the practice of ranking high in the search results for a generic term the path isnt to be found when someone types in a generic term the path is to have someone care enough about you and what you create that theyll type in your name that theyll be looking for you not a generic alternative say bread ingredients cost 195 the baker who charges 2 a loaf has to sell twentyone loaves for every loaf the luxury baker sells at 3 twentyone times as many is the difference between a few customers an hour or a line out the door but our customers would prefer to pay the lower price perhaps but how do they value the sparkling clean shop with plenty of wellpaid and helpful staff a new sign in the window and a local baseball team with new jerseys with your logo on them how do they value the handsome shopping bag that comes with every loaf not to mention the free samples of the little butter cookies you call punitions how does it make them feel to tell their friends that theyre eating the same bread thats served at the fancy restaurant down the street better to apologize for the price once than to have to excuse a hundred small slights again and again price is a signal cheap is another way to say scared when youre the cheapest youre not promising change youre promising the same but cheaper two offerings married to each other 1 free ideas that spread 2 expensive expressions of those ideas that are worth paying for real permission works like this if you stop showing up people are concerned they ask where you went facebook and other social platforms seem like a shortcut because they make it apparently easy to reach new people but the tradeoff is that youre a sharecropper its not your land you dont have permission to contact people they do you dont own an asset they do every author of ideas needs to own a permission asset the privilege of contacting people without a middleman media stunts come from a place of selfishness the best reason someone talks about you is because theyre actually talking about themselves look at how good my taste is or perhaps look at how good i am at spotting important ideas the best way to earn trust is through action we remember what you did long after we forget what you said marketers spend a lot of time talking and on working on what were going to say we need to spend far more time doing becoming an outlier isnt a strategy its a wish to satisfy the early adopters you may just need to annoy the masses the middle of the curve isnt eagerly adopting theyre barely adapting the very thing your innovation did break things is the one thing that the mass market doesnt want to happen two simple questions what will i tell my friends why will i tell them a simple threestep narrative for action the story of self the story of us and the story of now 1 story of self gives you standing a platform from which to speak story of transition from who you used to be to who you became story of self is your chance to explain that you are people like us that you did things like this that your actions led to a change one we can hear and see and understand 2 story of us is the kernel of a tribe why are we alike why should we care how we will benefit when were part of people like us 3 story of now is the critical pivot it enlists the tribe on your journey its the peer opportunitypeer pressure of the tribe that will provide the tension for all of us to move forward together if we leave the others behind it wont work the urgency of now requires that we do it together without delay without remorse without giving in to our fear
